What is time exactly? A fraction of existence? Tick. Tick. Tick. Seconds go by. Some of us see time before others. Our world is separated by timezones.

So what would happen if we could connect people in different times zones at the exact same time (on the clock).

This exhibit won't be about checking in at the time where you are, but where you call home. But that time is then translated into a global time.

For example, John is from New York. The time in New York when he checks into the exhibit is 12:30. Let's forget about the fact that it is 17:30 in London, where the exhibit is located.  

I am from San Francisco. It is 9:30 Pacific where I call home, even though I am in London at 17:30.

So we have checkin from John at 12:30, and JeanCarl at 9:30. If JeanCarl visits three hours later and checks in, he would check in at the same as John. But JeanCarl wouldn't see John next to him, since both visits are at completely different moments in time. But the moment is time is visually the same.

So what is time? What is the visual representation of time? What is usually a contant in our lives is turned into a random thing.
